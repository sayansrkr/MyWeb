    <br>
    <p>A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or many humans. It is a fully or semi sheltered space and can<br> have both interior and exterior aspects to it. Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as<br> sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space.<sup>[1]</sup>the<br> aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales; from the micro scale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct<br> surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet.</p>
    
    <h3>History</h3>

    <h2><strong>Prehistoric era</strong> </h2>
    <img src="image\img2.jpg" alt="this is a image file" width="300" align="right">
    <p>The earliest homes that humans inhabited were likely naturally occurring features such as caves. The earliest human fossils found in caves come from a series of caves near Krugersdorp and Mokopane in South Africa. The cave sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai B, Drimolen, Malapa, Cooper's D, Gladysvale, Gondolin and Makapansgat have yielded a range of early human species dating back to between three and one million years ago, including Australopithecus africanus, Australopithecus sediba and Paranthropus robustus. However, it is not generally thought that these early humans were living in the caves, but that they were brought into the caves by carnivores that had killed them.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>
    <br>
    <p>The first early hominid ever found in Africa, the Taung Child in <sup>1924</sup>, was also thought for many years to come from a cave, where it had been deposited after being preyed upon by an eagle. However, this is now debated.<sup></sup> Caves do form in the dolomite of the Ghaap Plateau, including the Early, Middle and Later Stone Age site of Wonderwerk Cave; however, the caves that form along the escarpment's edge, like that hypothesized for the Taung Child, are formed within a secondary limestone deposit called tufa. There is numerous evidence for other early human species inhabiting caves from at least one million years ago in different parts of the world, including Homo erectus in China at Zhoukoudian, Homo rhodesiensis in South Africa at the Cave of Hearths (Makapansgat), Homo neanderthalensis and Homo heidelbergensis in Europe at Archaeological Site of Atapuerca, Homo floresiensis in Indonesia, and the Denisovans in southern Siberia.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In southern Africa, early modern humans regularly used sea caves as shelter starting about <sup>180,000 </sup>years ago when they learned to exploit the sea for the first time.<sup>[5] </sup>The oldest known site is PP13B at Pinnacle Point. This may have allowed rapid expansion of humans out of Africa and colonization of areas of the world such as Australia by 60–50,000 years ago. Throughout southern Africa, Australia, and Europe, early modern humans used caves and rock shelters as sites for rock art, such as those at Giants Castle. Caves such as the yaodong in China were used for shelter; other caves were used for burials (such as rock-cut tombs), or as religious sites (such as Buddhist caves). Among the known sacred caves are China's Cave of a Thousand Buddhas<sup>[7]</sup> and the sacred caves of Crete. As technology progressed, humans and other hominids began constructing their own dwellings. Buildings such as huts and longhouses have been used for living since the late Neolithic.1<sup>[7]</sup></p>

    <h2><strong>Post-classical era</strong></h2>
    <p>From the 14th to the 16th century, homelessness was perceived of as a "vagrancy problem" and legislative responses to the problem were predicated upon the threat it may pose to the state.[8]</p>

    <h3>Modern era</h3>

    <p>According to Kirsten Gram-Hanssen, "It can be argued that historically and cross-culturally there is not always [a] strong relation between the concept of home and the physical building, and that this mode of thinking is rooted in the Enlightenment of the seventeenth century".[9] Before, one's home was more public than private; traits such as privacy, intimacy and familiarity would proceed to achieve greater prominence, aligning the concept with the bourgeoisie.[10][11] The connection between home and house was reinforced by a case law declaration from Edward Coke: "The house of everyman is to him as his castle and fortresse, as well as his defense against injury and violence, as for his repose". Colloquially, this was adapted into the phrase "The Englishman's home is his castle" which popularised the notion of home as house.[12]</p>
    <p>The concept of a smart home arose in the 19th century in turn with electricity having been introduced to homes in a limited capacity.[9]</p>

    <h2>Common types</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The concept of home is one with multiple interpretations, influenced by one's history and identity.[13] Commonly, it is associated with various forms of abodes such as wagons, cars, boats or tents.[8][14] The space of a home need not be significant or fixed.[14] There have been multiple theories regarding one's choice of home with the residential conditions of their childhood often reflected in their later choice of home.[10] According to Paul Oliver, the vast majority of abodes are vernacular, constructed in accordance with the residents' needs.[15]</p>

    <p>The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household. Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals. Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure. A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools. A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Joseph Rykwert distinguished between home and house in their physicality; a house requires a building whereas a home does not.[18] Home and house are often used interchangeably.[19]</p>
     <h3><strong>Moveable structures</strong></h3>
     <br>
     <img src="image\img5.jpg" alt="This is a image" width="300" align="right">
     <p>Home as constitutionally mobile and transient has been contended by anthropologists and sociologist.[20] A mobile home (also known as a house trailer, park home, trailer, or trailer home) is a prefabricated structure, built in a factory on a permanently attached chassis before being transported to site (either by being towed or on a trailer). Used as permanent homes, or for holiday or temporary accommodation, they are often left permanently or semi-permanently in one place, but can be moved, and may be required to move from time to time for legal reasons.</p>
     <br>
     <p>A houseboat is a boat that has been designed or modified to be used primarily as a home. Some houseboats are not motorized, because they are usually moored, kept stationary at a fixed point and often tethered to land to provide utilities. However, many are capable of operation under their own power. Float house is a Canadian and American term for a house on a float (raft); a rough house may be called a shanty boat.[21] In Western countries, houseboats tend to be either owned privately or rented out to holiday-goers, and on some canals in Europe, people dwell in houseboats all year round. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, Amsterdam, London, and Paris.[22]</p>
     <br>
     <p>A traditional yurt or ger is a portable round tent covered with skins or felt and used as a dwelling by several distinct nomadic groups in the steppes of Central Asia. The structure consists of an angled assembly or latticework of wood or bamboo for walls, a door frame, ribs (poles, rafters), and a wheel (crown, compression ring) possibly steam-bent. The roof structure is often self-supporting, but large yurts may have interior posts supporting the crown. The top of the wall of self-supporting yurts is prevented from spreading by means of a tension band which opposes the force of the roof ribs. Modern yurts may be permanently built on a wooden platform; they may use modern materials such as steam-bent wooden framing or metal framing, canvas or tarpaulin, plexiglass dome, wire rope, or radiant insulation.</p>
